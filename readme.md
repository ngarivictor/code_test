Consider a dataset providing information on the functionality of infrastructure resources, for each water point it includes the name of village it is in and its functional state.

Implement a data processing module which takes a dataset URL as input and returns:

-The number of water points that are functional

-The number of water points per community

-The rank for each community by the percentage of broken water points

There should be a top level object or function ? calculate("http://...").., which returns a data structure with the above information, something like { number_functional: ..., number_water_points: { communityA: ..., }, community_ranking: ... }
